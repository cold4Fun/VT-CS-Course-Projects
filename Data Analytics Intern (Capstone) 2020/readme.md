This is the project I coorperated with Dr. Feng Guo, primary data scientist at Virginia Tech Transportation Institute. 

U.S Fatality Analysis and study of influence of automated driving

Here is my main contribution: 
  • Investigated the characteristics of auto-mobile crashes using several key national crash database from NHTSA’s databases and applied
multi-linear regression and multinomial logistic regression to build prediction models.
  • Used the Change Point method to detect significant changes of fatalities within time series and related them to innovations of automobile
safety technologies around that time point to help figure out how automated driving could influence future fatalities.
  • Used the Monte-Carlo simulation in conjunction with the Population Attributable Risk Formula to predict the total percentageof crashes
that could be eliminated with the increased prevalence and effectiveness of certain automated driving technologies.

  In this project, I took part in every data science cycle: data exploring, data wrangling, model building, etc.. Except my partner Qi Xu did most of the general data statistics visualizations.
  My most important contribution here is to build a time series study from 1980 and apply change point package in R and monte carlo alogorithm to find out the possible influence with automated driving Lvl 2.
