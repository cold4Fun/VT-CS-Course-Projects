This is a R based project I did in my undergrad. The main purpose of this project is to find out how 3 pointers changed the league in aspects like how player's salary related to their 3 point skills, how their 3 pointer skill improved over time
Also, I did some interesting study like who is the greatest 3 point shooter ever? How player in different position improved their three point shooting skills.
