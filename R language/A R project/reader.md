This is a R project I did in undergrad. And it is about using the nba database to do some general statistics study and also I want to learn about how the introduction of three pointers changed the league completely since 1980. And also some I studied some interesting subjects like: how salary of player correlates to their three pointer ability; who is the best three point shooter ever?
